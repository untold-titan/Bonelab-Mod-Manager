# Bonelab Mod Manager
---
A Simple Mod Manager written in flutter, that interacts with the mod.io API to make finding and installing mods easier!

Currently this manager only supports mods that do not use MelonLoader/LemonLoader, since it only downloads the pallets and installs them to Bonelab's Mod folder. 

Supports searching for mods, as well as installing them.

If you have any feedback, or find a bug, please open an issue.
